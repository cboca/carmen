				<section id="about">
					<p class="about-quote">Anchora imparo: still I am learning.</p>
					<p>I am insatiably curious and ask a lot of questions.</p>
					<p>I am a great listener.</p>
					<p>I am tenacious about balancing business and human goals.</p>
					<p>I seek out challenges and welcome negative feedback. I challenge others to do the same.</p>
					<p>I share knowledge openly because I want us all to be better.</p>
					<p>I do not believe in waiting to be told what to do; I believe sometimes the best choice is just to act.</p>
					<p>I am an idealist, a humanitarian, and a dreamer. I'm an INTP.</p>
					<p>I am a science-minded researcher. I love abstract ideas and functional utilities.</p>
					<p>I want to create harmony between humans and systems, dissonance as a catalyst for change, and ultimately make the world a better place with ethical design.</p>
					<p>I'm looking to work in a progressive company with a UX team who work on transforming brands who are just doing marketing to powerful brands driven by a harmonious business and user experience strategies. </p>
