                        <p>It’s been my life motto – I never stop being amazed at the great, wide universe and all the things that I have not discovered yet. so I keep seeking, questioning, and learning. </p>
                        <p>My process is to ask questions, dig deep, uncover what I didn’t know, interface early and often with all stakeholders, create ideas based on investigation, reflect, make insights, sketch sketch sketch, and test and learn. That is how I tackle things in life: diligently and with passion and curiosity.</p>

                        <p>Dognition is a NC start-up that offers a revolutionary new tool that reveals your dog's unique style of thinking.  By using cognitive science, Dognition can reveal how an individual dog interacts with his people and surroundings. I worked with scientists and researchers from Duke University to balance great customer experience with the scientific method, based on design principles and information design. I worked on a vast spectrum of tasks from concepting to marketing to instructional and information design, video storyboarding, complex logic systems, and user portal experiences along with content strategy and creation of content.</p>

                        <p>Even in our challenging economic times, many don’t think they could ever end up homeless. We created Spent to let everyone walk for a virtual month in the shoes of someone living on the edge of homelessness. With over 2.5 million plays, we raised awareness and built empathy for those that Urban Ministries serves. I partnered with developers to create the game design, interaction and interface design, marketing strategy, user research and testing, and content creation. </p>
