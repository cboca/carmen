                        <p>it’s been my life motto – still I am learning. </p>

                        <p>my process is to ask questions, dig deep, uncover what I do not know, interface early and often with stakeholders, create ideas based on investigation, reflect, make insights, sketch sketch sketch, and test and learn. That is how I tackle things in life: diligently and with passion and curiosity.</p>
